                                    I am Leslie Grace Pelor, a young and ambitious student of Information Technology at
                                    Asia Pacific College. As I turn 20
                                    today, I am still exploring my career path and considering my options. However, I am
                                    determined to not let any
                                    opportunities slip by and to make the most of my education and skills. While my
                                    ultimate dream is to become a successful
                                    businesswoman, I am also open to the possibilities of utilizing my knowledge and
                                    skills as a future ui/ux or web developer. I am
                                    ready to embrace the challenges and opportunities that come my way and make a
                                    meaningful impact in whatever field I
                                    choose.

                                    My aspiration is to find true inner peace within myself, by learning to accept
                                    myself as I am, letting go of self-doubt
                                    and negative self-talk, and embracing my own unique journey. I will strive to live
                                    in the present moment, cultivate
                                    self-compassion, and to find balance and harmony within my mind and body. I will
                                    work to find my inner calm, and to be
                                    at peace with myself, in order to be able to share that peace with others.

                                    My hobbies drastically changed when I faced my worst fear: a torn knee meniscus. As
                                    I continue to heal, I had to say
                                    goodbye to my beloved physical activities, particularly dancing. Although it was a
                                    difficult transition, I was able to
                                    discover new hobbies that do not put strain on my knee. These include reading,
                                    binge-watching, and engaging in other
                                    low-impact activities. One of my favorite books is "A Man Called Ove" by Fredrick
                                    Backman, and my favorite movie, other
                                    than studio films, is "Love, Rosie." If you're ever in need of book or movie
                                    recommendations, I'd be more than happy to
                                    provide some suggestions.

                                    <i>People are capable, at any time in their lives, of doing what they dream of.
                                        -Paulo Coelho</i>

                                    This quote resonates with me because it reminds me that I am capable of achieving
                                    my
                                    dreams and aspirations, regardless
                                    of my current circumstances. It gives me motivation and encouragement to pursue my
                                    goals and to believe in myself. It
                                    reminds me that if I have the determination and will to make it happen, I can
                                    achieve anything I set my mind to.
